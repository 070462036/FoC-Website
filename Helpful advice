Commit new file - to update this github you need to go scroll to the bottom, pop in a title or advice then commit.
Either to the master which changes the main file (don't worry all history versions are available per commit - so use 
very helpful titles pls or a new branch which you can push to us/mess more with if u think ur doing something bold/big
Or create your own branch - then push to check (only useful for Ryan and Lewis changing each other's html)
